Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the Barker's and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

It's so noisy at the fair, but all your friends are there
And the candy-floss you had, and your mother and your dad

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the Barker's and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

There's a girl just down the aisle, oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote as you read the hidden note

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the Barker's and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

Now, you're underneath the stairs and you're given back some glares
To the people who you met and it's your first cigarette

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the Barker's and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

Now, you say you're leaving home because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel when you're finding out it's real

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the Barker's and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the Barker's and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
