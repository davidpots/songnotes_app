I hear the train a coming, it's rolling around the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine, since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps dragging on
But that train keeps a-rolling, on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my Mama told me, "Son"
"Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
