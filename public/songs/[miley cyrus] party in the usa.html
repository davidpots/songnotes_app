</span>I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame, excess... (whoa) am I gonna fit in
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign

This is all so crazy... everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio, and the Jay-Z song was on

<span class="chords_inline">(no chord)
</span>And the Jay-Z song was on... and the Jay-Z song was on

</span>    So I put my hands up, they're playing my song
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">Em</strong>                          <strong class="chord">D</strong>
</span>    ...The butterflies fly away
    I'm nodding my head like "Yeah"
    Moving my hips like "Yeah"

    Got my hands up, they're playing my song
    I know I'm gonna be okay
    Yeah----- it's a party in the USA
    Yeah----- it's a party in the USA

Get to the club in my taxi cab, everybody's looking at me now
Like "who's that chick that's rockin' kicks, she's gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party

'Cause all I see is stilettos... I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune, and the Britney song was on

And the Britney song was on... and the Britney song was on

    So I put my hands up, they're playing my song
    The butterflies fly away
    I'm nodding my head like "Yeah"
    Moving my hips like "Yeah"

    Got my hands up, they're playing my song
    I know I'm gonna be okay
    Yeah----- it's a party in the USA
    Yeah----- it's a party in the USA

NOTES
===============================================================================

<p>The riff that is played through the intro and verse is played like this:</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|---/7---x-x-x----7----10----7---x-x-x-x-x---7-7---7---
B-|---/8---x-x-x----7-----7----8---x-x-x-x-x---8-8---5---
G-|---/7---x-x-x----7-----7----9---x-x-x-x-x---9-9---5---
D-|---(9)----------(9)--------(9)-------------------(5)--

       <strong class="chord">G</strong>            <strong class="chord">Bm</strong>         <strong class="chord">Em</strong>                    <strong class="chord">D</strong></span></pre>
       
<p>Note that the recorded version of the song is in the key of <strong class="chord">F#</strong>. If you want to play along with that, move everything down one half-step. I much prefer playing it in G, as it allows you to use open chords for the <strong class="chord">G</strong> (instead of <strong class="chord">F#</strong>), <strong class="chord">Em</strong> (instead of <strong class="chord">D#</strong>), <strong class="chord">D</strong> (instead of <strong class="chord">C#</strong>), etc.</p>
