People say I'm crazy...
               C
Doing what I'm doing
Well, they give me all kinds of warnings
To save me from ruin

    F               Dm
    When I say that I'm OK
              G
    Well, they look at me kind of strange
    Surely you're not happy now
    You no longer play the game

People say I'm lazy
Dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me

    When I tell them that I'm doing fine
    Watching shadows on the wall
    Don't you miss the big time boy
    You're no longer on the ball

        F           G                         C                   Am
        ...I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
        F           Dm                        F
        ...I really love to watch them roll
        G                          Am
        ...No longer riding on the merry-go-round
        F         F7               C  C/B  C/A    C/G  F
        ...I just had to let it go

Ah, people asking questions
Lost in confusion
Well, I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions

    Well, they shake their heads and they look at me
    As if I've lost my mind
    I tell them there's no hurry
    I'm just sitting here doing time

        I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
        I really love to watch them roll
        No longer riding on the merry-go-round
        F                          C    C/B    C/A   G/G
        ...I just had to let it go
        F        (Fm6)             Cmaj7
        ...I just had to let it go
