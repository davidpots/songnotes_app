ROYALS
by Lorde
===============================================================================

VERSE
                      D 
    I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
            (C)                           (G)
    I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
                D 
    And I'm not proud of my address
                  (C)                (G) 
    In the torn up town, no post code envy

PRE-CHORUS
                               D 
        But every song's like, gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
        Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
        C                              G 
        We don't care... we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

                              D 
        But everybody's like, Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
        Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
        C                         G 
        We don't care...we aren't caught up in your love affair

CHORUS
                               D 
            And we'll never be royals (royals)
            It don't run in our blood
                         C 
            That kind of luxe just ain't for us
                       G 
            We crave a different kind of buzz

                           D 
            Let me be your ruler (ruler)
            You can call me Queen Bee
                           C 
            And baby, I'll rule... (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule...)
            G 
            ...Let me live that fantasy

    My friends and I, we've cracked the code
    We count our dollars on the train to the party
    And everyone who knows us knows
    That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

        But every song's like, gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
        Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
        We don't care... we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

        But everybody's like, Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
        Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
        We don't care...we aren't caught up in your love affair

            And we'll never be royals (royals)
            It don't run in our blood
            That kind of luxe just ain't for us
            We crave a different kind of buzz

            Let me be your ruler (ruler)
            You can call me Queen Bee
            And baby I'll rule... (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule...)
            Let me live that fantasy

BRIDGE
                D                    C  
                ...Ohhh, ohhh.... oooooo....
                We're bigger than we ever dreamed
                G 
                ...And I'm in love with being queen

                D                    C 
                ...Ohhh, ohhh.... oooooo....
                Life is great without a care
                          G 
                We aren't caught up in your love affair

            And we'll never be royals (royals)
            It don't run in our blood
            That kind of luxe just ain't for us
            We crave a different kind of buzz

            Let me be your ruler (ruler)
            You can call me Queen Bee
            And baby I'll rule... (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule...)
            Let me live that fantasy

NOTES & TABS
===============================================================================

Guitar Chords Used
At its simplest, you can play this song using only the typical D, C, and G chords. With that said, there are a few subtle creative licenses you may want to take throughout the song -- so I've included some alternate ways to play each of the chords. Pick what works for you.

e-|---2---0---3---   ---2---3---3---   ---x---  ----------------
B-|---3---1---0---   ---3---3---3---   ---3---   ---7---5-------
G-|---2---0---0---   ---2---0---0---   ---2---   ---7---5---4---
D-|---0---2---0---   ---0---2---0---   ---0---   ---7---5---5---
A-|-------3---2---   -------3---2---   -------   ---5---3---5---
E-|-----------3---   -----------3---   -------   -----------3---
      D   C   G         D   C9  G         D5        D   C   G 

Playing the Verse with One Chord
As noted above, the implied tonality of the verse is D the entire time, without any switches. This can be tricky to play with a guitar, as it can sound quite monotonous. To make it work, I'd recommend bringing in a heavy percussive element to your strumming (using muted strums, knocking the guitar, etc) -- with a focus on accenting the 2nd and 4th beat of each measure. Also, it may help to play the D5 variant of the D (by not playing the highest string) -- this lets the droning aspect of the chord shine through. Finally -- another option is to in fact use the D-C-G progression within the verse (the same progression used throughout the song)... one of the covers below employ this approach. Do what works for you, and have fun!

Recommended Guitar Covers
Here's a very well done cover of this song featuring a single acoustic guitar (and two talented singers). Their guitar approach is quite simple, yet you'll see that a simple approach is all that is needed -- the vocals can carry the bulk of the weight.

Here's another cover with a single guitar (and two singers) -- this one is notable in that they use the D-C-G progression in the verse, instead of simply staying on the D chord. This creates more of a rich sound, and is a bit less droning. Check it out -- it is a great example of how you can make it work in a slightly different way.

Advanced Guitar Version
I had to include this version due to its awesomeness. This is an instrumental version without vocals, but his guitar chops are quite impressive. If you want to see how to take the percussive aspect to the next level, check this out.
