We could sit beneath the evening, let the day turn blue
I could never let the darkness replace the thought of you
C'mon, darling let's catch that train to wherever we call God
Maybe it's in Massachusetts, or... maybe not

It's just you and I, it's just you and I, my dear
You and I, it's just you and I...

Let's keep our boots pointed west, stay left of the police
Well, I know you're like a freight train to escape your family
You've got a father who has done you wrong, and a mother who doesn't care
Get your backbone up my darling, let down your hair

It's just you and I, it's just you and I, my dear
You and I, it's just you and I...

When all the world turns into hospitals and jails
I can always count on your love to be my bail
And we'll go traveling on from year to year, yeah
...Just you and I, my dear

I've got my backpack full of fourteen cartons of cigarettes, cigarettes
I've got a bumper sticker on my chest that says no regrets, no regrets
I've got your love draped all around me like a big black cape, a big black cape
All the billboards on the highway say don't be late, don't be late

It's just you and I, it's just you and I, my dear
You and I, it's just you and I...

When all the world turns into hospitals and jails
I can always count on your love to be my bail
And we'll go traveling on from year to year, yeah
...Just you and I, my dear

Well I woke up in the middle of the kitchen floor
I was listening for your knocking, but you weren't outside my door
And I know that you won't be coming 'round in the way I want you to
I wish you'd throw your arms around me

But it's not for me, it's not for me
It's not to be, it'll be just me

And I know I never told you how I felt
But you could never understand the blues that you have dealt me
So I'll keep traveling on from year to year, yeah
...Just you and I, my dear
...Just you and I, my dear
...It'll be the same every year
...It'll be just me, my dear
