LOVE STORY
by Taylor Swift
===============================================================================
INTRO
    D ... Bm ... G ... A ... (see riff below)

VERSE
    D         
    We were both young when I first saw you
      Bm
    I close my eyes and the flashback starts
                 G                         A
    I'm standing there... in a balcony and summer air
    
    See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
    See you make your way through the crowd
    And say hello... little did I know

PRE-CHORUS
             G                        A
        That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
               Bm                          D
        And my Daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
                  G                
        And I was crying on the staircase
        A                        Bm    A 
        Begging you please don't go....... and I said
        
CHORUS
          D 
          Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
          A
          I'll be waiting, all we've got to do is run
          Bm                
          You be the prince and I'll be the princess
          G                  A (let ring)           D
          It's a love story, baby just say... "yes"
    
    So, I sneak out to the garden to see you
    Keeping quiet, 'cause we're dead if he knew
    So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while
    
      Oh, 'cause you were Romeo, I was the scarlet letter
      And my Daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
      And you were everything to me
      I was begging you please don't go... and I said

          Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
          I'll be waiting, all we've got to do is run
          You be the prince and I'll be the princess
          It's a love story, baby just say "yes"
        
          Romeo, save me... they're trying to tell me how to feel
          This love is difficult, but it's so real
          Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
          It's a love story, baby just say "yes"
    
          (instrumental chorus x1)

BRIDGE
                             Bm       G
              I got tired of waiting...
                           D                        A
              Wondering if you were ever coming around
              My faith in you was fading
              When I met you on the outskirts of town... and I said
          
          Romeo, save me... I've been feeling so alone
          I keep waiting for you but you never come
          Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
          He knelt to the ground, and pulled a ring and said
          
          "Marry me, Juliet You never have to be alone
          I love you, and that's all I really know
          I talked to your Dad, go pick out a white dress
          It's a love story, baby just say..."
           
          "Yes..."
          Oh, oh...
          Oh, oh...
          'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
