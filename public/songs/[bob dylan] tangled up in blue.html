</span>    Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red
    Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough
    They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's banquet wasn't big enough

    She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced
    Helped her out of a jam I guess, but I used a little too much force
    We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west
    Split up on the docks at night, both agreeing that it was best

        She turned around to look at me as I was walking away
        I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue"
        Tangled up in blue

    I had a job in the great north woods workin' as a cook for a spell
    But I never did like it all that much and one day the axe just fell
    So I drifted down to New Orleans where my luck it was to be employed
    Workin' for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix

        But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind
        I've seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
        Tangled up in blue

    She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer
    I just kept lookin' at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear
    And later on when the crowd thinned down I'se just about to do the same
    She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me "Don't I know your name?"

        I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines on my face
        I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoes
        Tangled up in blue

    She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
    "I thought you'd never say hello," she said. "You look like the silent type."
    Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me
    Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century

        And everyone of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal
        Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul from me to you
        Tangled up in blue

    I lived with him on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs
    There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air
    And he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died
    She had to sell everything she owned, and froze up inside

        And when then finally the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn
        The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
        Tangled on in blue

    So now I'm going back again, I get to get to her somehow
    All the people we used to know, there an illusion to me now
    Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters wives
    Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives

        But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint
        We always did feel the same we just saw it from a different point of view
        Tangled up in blue</pre>
