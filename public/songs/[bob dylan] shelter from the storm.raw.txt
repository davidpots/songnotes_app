'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue, and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men fighting to be warm
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where its always safe and warm
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

Now, there's a wall between us, something has been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think how it all began on a non-eventful morn
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

Well, the deputy walks on hot nails and the preacher rides amount
But nothing really matters much, its doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

I've heard new-born babies wailing like a moanin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question then, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

In a little hill-top village they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm

I'm living in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Come in she said I'll give you shelter from the storm
