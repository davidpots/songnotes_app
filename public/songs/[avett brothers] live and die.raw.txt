All it'll take is just one moment, and
You can say goodbye to how we had it planned
Fear like a habit, run like a rabbit out and away
Through the screen door to the unknown

And I wanna love you and more
I wanna find you and more
Where do you reside when you hide
How can I find you

'Cause I wanna send you and more
I wanna tempt you and more
Can you tell that I am alive
Let me prove it

You and I, we're the same 
Live and die, we're the same 
Hear my voice, know my name 
You and I, we're the same

Live like a pharaoh, sing like a sparrow, anyway
Even if there is no land or love in sight
We bloom like roses, lead like Moses, out and away
Through the bitter crowd to the daylight

And I wanna love you and more
I wanna find you and more
Can you tell that I am alive
Let me prove it to you

You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I, we're the same

Live and die, we're the same
You and I, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I, we're the same

And I wanna love you and more
I wanna find you and more
Where do you reside when you hide
How can I find you

'Cause I wanna send you and more
I wanna tempt you and more
Can you tell that I am alive
Let me prove it

You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I, we're the same

Live and die, we're the same
You and I, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I... you and I...
